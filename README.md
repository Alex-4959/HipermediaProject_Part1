# Personal CV Website ‚Äî √Älex Cimbron Morales

This project is part of the *Multimedia and User Interfaces* course.  
It consists of designing and developing a **personal CV webpage** using **Figma (design phase)** and **HTML + CSS (implementation phase)**.

## üë§ Project analysis ‚Äî User profile

The target user for this website is a **computer engineering student** who wants to showcase their education, skills, and personal projects in a clear and professional way.  
The website is intended to serve both as an **online CV** and as a **portfolio** that can be shared with teachers, potential employers, or collaborators.

**User Persona example:**
- **Name:** Alex Cimbron Morales  
- **Age:** 21  
- **Occupation:** Third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Girona  
- **Goals:** Present his academic background, experience, and programming projects in a modern and interactive format.  
- **Frustrations:** Traditional CVs feel outdated and limited; he prefers a clean and responsive online format.  
- **Needs:** A personal website that works on all devices, with intuitive navigation and visual consistency.

## üß≠ Project analysis ‚Äî Information architecture

The structure of the page follows a **simple single-page layout** where all the content is divided into clear and scrollable sections:

1. **Header / Navigation bar** ‚Äî Fixed at the top with links to each section.  
2. **Hero section** ‚Äî Includes name, brief description, and buttons (‚ÄúView projects‚Äù and ‚ÄúDownload CV‚Äù).  
3. **About me** ‚Äî A short self-introduction highlighting academic focus and professional goals.  
4. **Skills** ‚Äî A list of technical abilities (HTML, CSS, Java, GitHub, Figma...).  
5. **Experience** ‚Äî Real working experiences: plumbing assistant in the family business, pizza delivery driver, and basketball coach.  
6. **Education** ‚Äî Academic path from ESO to university.  
7. **Projects** ‚Äî List of university and personal projects with GitHub links.  
8. **Contact** ‚Äî Email and GitHub link.  
9. **Footer** ‚Äî Copyright and year.

This structure keeps navigation intuitive and reduces cognitive load for the user.  
All content is accessible without changing pages, which reinforces simplicity and usability.  
The architecture mirrors the logic of a modern responsive CV/portfolio.
