# Personal CV Website — Àlex Cimbron Morales

This project is part of the *Multimedia and User Interfaces* course.  
It consists of designing and developing a **personal CV webpage** using **Figma (design phase)** and **HTML + CSS (implementation phase)**.

## Project analysis — User profile

The target user for this website is a **computer engineering student** who wants to showcase their education, skills, and personal projects in a clear and professional way.  
The website is intended to serve both as an **online CV** and as a **portfolio** that can be shared with teachers, potential employers, or collaborators.

**User Persona example:**
- **Name:** Alex Cimbron Morales  
- **Age:** 21  
- **Occupation:** Third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Girona  
- **Goals:** Present his academic background, experience, and programming projects in a modern and interactive format.  
- **Frustrations:** Traditional CVs feel outdated and limited; he prefers a clean and responsive online format.  
- **Needs:** A personal website that works on all devices, with intuitive navigation and visual consistency.

## Project analysis — Information architecture

The structure of my CV website is modern and interactive, allowing the user to move quickly between sections through smooth internal links.
The layout follows the logic of a traditional curriculum vitae but presented in a digital, accessible, and visually dynamic way.

The website starts with a fixed header that contains the main navigation links, giving direct access to each section of the page.
The hero section includes my full name, a short one-line personal description, a photograph, and two action buttons: one to view my projects (useful for employers who want to see my work) and another to download the CV in PDF format.

After that, the page is divided into several sections that represent the main areas of a complete CV:

About me, where I describe my goals, interests, and personal motivation.

Skills, listing the technical abilities and knowledge I have developed during my studies and work experience.

Experience, summarizing my professional background and the different jobs I have done.

Education, showing my academic path.

Projects, with a short description and direct GitHub links for each project.

Contact, including my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email address to make communication easy.

The entire structure was designed to be simple, intuitive, and fast to navigate while keeping a professional and elegant dark-theme style that contrasts light text and blue accent colors.

## Project analysis — Visual design

For this project, I created a modern and interactive structure that feels dynamic and easy to navigate.
I wanted the design to look professional but also attractive, so I chose a dark color palette that gives the page a clean and elegant appearance.
The contrast between the dark background and the white text, combined with light blue elements, makes the content easier to read and highlights the important parts of the page such as buttons or section titles.

The general structure follows the idea of ​​a real CV, but with a digital and more visual format.
At the top, there is a header with all the navigation links that let users move through the different sections of the site smoothly.
The main section includes my full name, a short description about me, my photograph, and two buttons — one to view my projects and another one to download the CV in PDF format.
Each section is organized clearly, with enough spacing and small design details like hover effects and horizontal lines that separate the content and make the reading experience more pleasant.

Overall, the visual design combines a professional and minimalist style with small interactive touches that make the page modern, functional, and appealing.
