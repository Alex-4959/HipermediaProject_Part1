# Personal CV Website â€” Ã€lex Cimbron Morales

This project is part of the *Multimedia and User Interfaces* course.  
It consists of designing and developing a **personal CV webpage** using **Figma (design phase)** and **HTML + CSS (implementation phase)**.

## ðŸ‘¤ Project analysis â€” User profile

The target user for this website is a **computer engineering student** who wants to showcase their education, skills, and personal projects in a clear and professional way.  
The website is intended to serve both as an **online CV** and as a **portfolio** that can be shared with teachers, potential employers, or collaborators.

**User Persona example:**
- **Name:** Alex Cimbron Morales  
- **Age:** 21  
- **Occupation:** Third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Girona  
- **Goals:** Present his academic background, experience, and programming projects in a modern and interactive format.  
- **Frustrations:** Traditional CVs feel outdated and limited; he prefers a clean and responsive online format.  
- **Needs:** A personal website that works on all devices, with intuitive navigation and visual consistency.

## ðŸ§­ Project analysis â€” Information architecture

The structure of my CV website is modern and interactive, allowing the user to move quickly between sections through smooth internal links.
The layout follows the logic of a traditional curriculum vitae but presented in a digital, accessible, and visually dynamic way.

The website starts with a fixed header that contains the main navigation links, giving direct access to each section of the page.
The hero section includes my full name, a short one-line personal description, a photograph, and two action buttons: one to view my projects (useful for employers who want to see my work) and another to download the CV in PDF format.

After that, the page is divided into several sections that represent the main areas of a complete CV:

About me, where I describe my goals, interests, and personal motivation.

Skills, listing the technical abilities and knowledge I have developed during my studies and work experience.

Experience, summarizing my professional background and the different jobs I have done.

Education, showing my academic path.

Projects, with a short description and direct GitHub links for each project.

Contact, including my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email address to make communication easy.

The entire structure was designed to be simple, intuitive, and fast to navigate while keeping a professional and elegant dark-theme style that contrasts light text and blue accent colors.

## ðŸŽ¨ Project analysis â€” Visual design

The visual design follows a **modern, dark-theme aesthetic** inspired by developer portfolios.  
Colors and styles were chosen to emphasize readability, visual hierarchy, and a professional look.

**Main design decisions:**
- **Color palette:** Dark blue-gray background (`#0f172a`) with light text (`#e5e7eb`) and cyan accent (`#38bdf8`) to highlight interactive elements.  
- **Typography:** Sans-serif system font (`system-ui`) for clarity and compatibility across devices.  
- **Layout:** A centered, responsive grid with consistent padding and spacing.  
- **Sections:** Separated with subtle horizontal gradient lines for smooth visual flow.  
- **Buttons and interactions:** Rounded buttons with hover effects and smooth transitions to give feedback and a dynamic feel.  
- **Accessibility:** Clear focus states (`outline`) and smooth scroll behavior for better usability.  
- **Consistency:** The same visual system from the Figma design was implemented in HTML and CSS to ensure coherence between design and final website.

This design creates a minimalist but elegant portfolio that aligns with the studentâ€™s professional and academic profile.
